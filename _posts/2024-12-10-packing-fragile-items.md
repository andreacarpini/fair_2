Packing fragile items is one of the most critical aspects of any move. Proper packing techniques can mean the difference between your cherished belongings arriving safely or ending up in pieces. Here's our comprehensive guide from the professionals at Fairplay Moving Inc.

## Essential Packing Materials

Before you begin, gather these professional-grade packing supplies:

- **Sturdy boxes** in various sizes
- **Bubble wrap** for cushioning
- **Packing paper** (not newspaper, which can leave ink stains)
- **Packing tape** (high-quality, not dollar store varieties)
- **Markers** for labeling
- **Foam peanuts** for filling gaps
- **Dish packs** (specialty boxes for kitchen items)

## Packing Different Types of Fragile Items

### Glasses and Stemware
1. Wrap each glass individually with packing paper
2. Stuff paper inside the glass for extra support
3. Use dividers in boxes for stemware
4. Pack glasses upright, not on their sides
5. Fill all empty spaces with crumpled paper

### Plates and Dishes
1. Wrap each plate individually
2. Stack plates vertically in boxes (like records)
3. Place cushioning material between each plate
4. Use dish packs for extra protection
5. Never overpack boxes with dishes

### Picture Frames and Artwork
1. Wrap frames in bubble wrap
2. Use corner protectors for valuable pieces
3. Pack in flat, picture boxes
4. Mark boxes clearly as "FRAGILE - ARTWORK"
5. Consider professional crating for valuable art

### Electronics
1. Use original boxes when possible
2. Wrap screens in anti-static bubble wrap
3. Remove batteries from devices
4. Label cords and accessories
5. Pack in climate-controlled conditions

## Professional Packing Techniques

### The Double-Box Method
For extremely fragile items, use the double-box method:
1. Pack the item in a smaller box with adequate cushioning
2. Place this box inside a larger box with additional padding
3. This provides extra protection during transport

### Proper Box Loading
- Place heavier items at the bottom
- Fill all empty spaces to prevent shifting
- Don't exceed 50 pounds per box
- Use plenty of cushioning material

### Labeling System
- Mark all fragile boxes clearly on multiple sides
- Use "FRAGILE" stickers prominently
- Indicate which side should face up
- Note the contents for easier unpacking

## When to Hire Professional Packers

While many people prefer to pack themselves, consider professional packing services for:

- **Valuable antiques** and heirlooms
- **Large collections** of breakables
- **Extremely fragile items** like crystal
- **Time constraints** that prevent careful packing
- **Long-distance moves** where items need maximum protection

## Cost of Professional Packing

Professional packing typically costs:
- $25-35 per hour per packer
- Plus materials (boxes, paper, tape)
- Often saves money by preventing damage
- Reduces moving time and stress

## Common Packing Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using newspaper** - Ink can transfer to items
2. **Overpacking boxes** - Makes them too heavy and prone to breaking
3. **Insufficient cushioning** - Items will shift and break
4. **Poor labeling** - Makes unpacking difficult
5. **Rushing the process** - Take time to pack properly

## Final Tips

- Start packing non-essentials early
- Pack room by room and label accordingly
- Take photos of complex setups before disassembling
- Keep a "first night" box with essentials
- Don't pack hazardous materials
